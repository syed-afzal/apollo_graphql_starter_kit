### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/syed-afzal/apollo_graphql_starter_kit)

## Overview :clipboard:

GraphQL API Server with Apollo, Node.js, MongoDB. Jwt Authentication, Cursor Pagination, DB Query Batching & Caching.

#### The features which covered are as follows.

‚ô¶ Build GraphQL API with Apollo Server in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

‚ô¶ Add JWT Authentication in Apollo GraphQL API.

‚ô¶ Implement Faster pagination with Cursor Based Pagination Strategy.The code of offset limit pagination is also there.

‚ô¶ Add Data Loaders to return data faster from the server with batching and caching your database query.

‚ô¶ Feel Confident with GraphQL Concepts such as Query, Mutation, and Subscription.

‚ô¶ Best practices in GraphQL and Build Scalable API with proper schema design.

It's sound good  :ok_hand: , so let's start :runner:

## Prerequisite

To understand the code you should have a basic knowledge of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), 
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) & my favourite language [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Steps to Run the Project

#### ‚ô¶ Setting up ENV file

Rename env.example to .env and fill in the details

```bash
PORT=
MONGO_DB_URL=
JWT_SECRET_KEY=
```
#### ‚ô¶ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

then RUN the command 

```bash
npm run dev
```

it will run the the project in development mode using nodemon

## Sample GraphQL Schema

```sh
const { gql } = require('apollo-server-express');

module.exports =  gql`
  extend type Query {
    user: User
  }
  
  extend type Mutation {
    signup(input: signupInput): User
    login(input: loginInput): Token
  }
  
  input signupInput {
    name: String!
    email: String!
    password: String!
  }
  
   input loginInput {
    email: String!
    password: String!
  }
  
  type Token {
    token: String!
  }
  
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    tasks: [Task!]
    createdAt: Date!
    updatedAt: Date!
  }
  
  extend type Subscription {
    userCreated: User
  }
`;
```

No need to üòï confuse it's a syntax to define Schema in **GraphQl**.

## Explanation

###### :clipboard: `Note: we used extend for Mutation, Query & Subscription because we defining all these in main server.js file`


##### ‚ô¶ Query

Query means to fetch the data from DB.
We extend for Query and we only have a query for user here, we can add more modules there as well.

##### ‚ô¶ Mutation

Mutation means to Create/Update/Delete the record from DB.
As you can see it is also extended like query but here we use two mutation.
The purpose of mutation is to edit/delete the data.

##### ‚ô¶ Subscription

Like queries, subscriptions enable you to fetch data. Unlike queries, subscriptions are long-lasting operations that can change their result over time.
Subscriptions are useful for notifying your client in real time about changes to back-end data, such as the creation of a new object or updates to an important field.
