It's sound good  :ok_hand: , so let's start :runner:

## Prerequisite

To understand the code you should have a basic knowledge of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), 
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) & my favourite language [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Steps to Run the Project

#### ‚ô¶ Setting up ENV file

Rename env.example to .env and fill in the details

```bash
PORT=
MONGO_DB_URL=
JWT_SECRET_KEY=
```
#### ‚ô¶ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

then RUN the command 

```bash
npm run dev
```

it will run the the project in development mode using nodemon
